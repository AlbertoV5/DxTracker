# DxTracker for Reaper (Resemblyzer)
Track different speakers with AI and add the info to a Reaper project

To Do 1:
Need to add multiple speaker comatibility.
Need to add 'no marker where other speaker talks' option.
Need to add no .csv option, add score to marker as 100% and make it so you can run the script from Reaper.
Need to add reload project or instantly open created project.

To Do 2:
Need to move away from markers and go into cutting items in Reaper in the specific spots and moving them to a new track.

To Do 3:
Make a DxTracker for console command use for python only (like Spleeter) and make a .lua or .py script to import the data to the reaper project.
Reminder: Never replace the source project, lmao.

Goal:
- Step 1: Send info from Reaper for Python to use, location of files for Track and Speakers.
- Step 2: Run Python script, do the A.I. stuff and send the info to a .csv or something.
- Step 3: Run .Lua script to read that .csv data in Reaper.
